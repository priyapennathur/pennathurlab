And I'm looking for great people to join the team! We're currently at population one: me. To be fair, we had a population of two during the summer, because Jarrod Shilts was tearing it up analyzing circadian gene expression in human cancer.

If you're hard-working, enthusiastic, and *&lt;insert more positive adjectives here, but not too many>* and interested in using computation to understand biology and improve human health, particularly in the context of circadian rhythms and sleep, please [get in touch](/join/)!

Hopefully now it won't feel so weird having that "hughey_lab" folder on my computer.

# Join the lab

I'm currently starting my own lab and looking for exceptional individuals to be part of the team. More than any particular skills, I'm interested in people who are hard-working, creative, and eager to learn. Successful applicants will have the opportunity to shape the research directions and the culture of the lab.

The focus of the lab is on using computation (machine learning, mathematical modeling, etc.) to understand dynamic biological systems relevant to human health and disease. The computational tools we develop and apply are designed for various types of data, from transcriptomes to electronic medical records.

We are particularly interested in the mammalian circadian system, the network of oscillators that drives daily rhythms in multiple aspects of our physiology. With support from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, we are excited to (1) develop new methods to measure the circadian system in single cells and in humans living in the real world, (2) use publicly available data to understand how the circadian clocks in each organ communicate with one another, and (3) use data from electronic medical records to explore the link between the circadian system and human phenotypes.

The lab has a rich set of collaborators, from experimental biologists to clinical researchers. The lab is located in Nashville, Tennessee, and is part of the Department of Biomedical Informatics and the [Vanderbilt Center for Precision Medicine](https://www.vumc.org/cpm).

Candidates at all levels are encouraged to apply. NIH-funded positions are available to start immediately.

## Staff scientists

Please apply through the [VUMC job site](https://vanderbilt.taleo.net/careersection/.vu_cs/jobdetail.ftl?job=1710692&tz=GMT-06%3A00).

## Postdocs

Strong candidates will likely have either:

- a PhD in a quantitative / computational field and experience with biological or clinical data
- a PhD in the biological sciences and a strong quantitative background

To apply, please email me:

- A description of your interest in the lab and the type of projects you would like to pursue.
- One paper and one piece of code (if you have coding experience) of which you are the primary author and that highlight your skills as a scientist, along with 1-2 sentences explaining your selection(s). Links to publicly available materials are fine.
- Up-to-date CV.
- Names and contact information of 2-3 references.

## Graduate students

Prospective graduate students can apply to the graduate program of the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/research-ms-and-phd-program) at Vanderbilt.

Current graduate students at Vanderbilt should email me a few sentences describing why they're interested in the lab, then we can discuss possible rotation projects.

## Undergraduates

Highly motivated undergraduates should email me a resume and a short description of their research interests.

## Mascots

Although the lab already has one [highly accomplished mascot](/people/schwarzbart-devi), I'm willing to consider additional outstanding applicants.

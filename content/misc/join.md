# Join the lab

I'm currently starting my own lab and am looking for exceptional individuals to be part of the team. More than any particular set of skills, I'm interested in people who are hard-working, creative, and eager to learn. Candidates at all levels are encouraged to apply.

The focus of the lab is on using computation, broadly defined, to understand dynamic biological systems relevant to human health and disease, particularly in the context of circadian rhythms. The lab has a rich set of collaborators, from experimental biologists to clinical researchers. The lab is also part of the [Vanderbilt Center for Precision Medicine](https://www.vumc.org/cpm).

## Postdocs

Strong candidates will likely have a PhD in a quantitative field, such as bioinformatics, computational biology, statistics, engineering, computer science, etc. Programming experience and experience working with biological or clinical data is a plus.

Prospective candidates should email me a description of their interest in the lab and the type of projects they would like to pursue, along with contact information for three references.

## Graduate students

Prospective graduate students can apply to the graduate program of the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/research-ms-and-phd-program) at Vanderbilt.

Current graduate students at Vanderbilt should email me a few sentences describing why they're interested in the lab, then we can discuss possible rotation projects.

## Undergraduates

Highly motivated undergraduates should email me a resume and a short description of their research interests.

## Mascots

Although the lab already has one [highly accomplished mascot](/people/devi-schwarzbart), we are willing to consider additional outstanding applicants.

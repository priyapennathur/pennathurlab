simphony simulates data from experiments in which the abundances of rhythmic and non-rhythmic features (e.g., genes) are measured at multiple time points in one or more conditions. simphony has parameters for specifying experimental design and modeling rhythms, including the ability to sample from Gaussian and negative binomial distributions.
